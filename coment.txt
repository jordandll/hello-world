`TimedAnimation` subclass that creates an animation by using a fixed
    set of `.Artist` objects.

    Before creating an instance, all plotting should have taken place
    and the relevant artists saved.

    .. note::

        You must store the created Animation in a variable that lives as long
        as the animation should run. Otherwise, the Animation object will be
        garbage-collected and the animation stops.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fig : `~matplotlib.figure.Figure`
        The figure object used to get needed events, such as draw or resize.
    artists : list
        Each list entry is a collection of `.Artist` objects that are made
        visible on the corresponding frame.  Other artists are made invisible.
    interval : int, default: 200
        Delay between frames in milliseconds.
    repeat_delay : int, default: 0
        The delay in milliseconds between consecutive animation runs, if
        *repeat* is True.
    repeat : bool, default: True
        Whether the animation repeats when the sequence of frames is completed.
    blit : bool, default: False
        Whether blitting is used to optimize drawing.
